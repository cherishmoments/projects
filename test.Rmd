## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Today we are going to plot some graphs using package tidyverse.
First, we have to install the package


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, we have to load in the dataset. We have the dataset in a csv file.

plot a graph 
```{r}

```

```{r}
data("airquality")

plot(airquality)

head(airquality)

summary(airquality)
```
We want to do a simple plot of temperature as the month go on.

```{r}
plot(airquality$Temp,airquality$month)
```

```{r}
barplot( )
```
